<h2 id="my-current-top-5-podcasts-on-spotify-and-elsewhere">My Current Top 5 Podcasts on Spotify (and elsewhere)</h2>
<p>Between interviewing for jobs, which is a job in itself, I find myself faced with a neverending list of household tasks to take care of. What makes it ok is that there is a corresponding neverending list of podcasts I have yet to listen to. I hate that feeling when you have burned through a series that you love <em>Hello &lsquo;Reply All&rsquo;</em> and are staring into the <strong>listener&rsquo;s abyss</strong>. But something new always comes along. Here are my current top five listens right now:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/528s8w9v4MKG55ZyQXHj9g?si=5-5a615tRDyeD8St-JgOSw" target="_blank">Too Scary Didnâ€™t Watch</a> (Spotify)
When I started listening to this show at the start of lockdown, I was definitely in the category of too scared to watch horror movies. But now, I can actually enjoy them. I love the girls who make this show, and they somehow manage to keep it interesting every week.</li>
<li><a href="%22https://open.spotify.com/show/4XPl3uEEL9hvqMkoZrzbx5?si=Rc2Z8IQBS5Se8_C7gblKRg%22">Darknet Diaries</a> (Spotify)
Incredible stories from the world of internet security by Jack Rhysider. Required listening for late night drives up New England and back.</li>
<li><a href="%22https://wondery.com/shows/even-the-rich/?_branch_match_id=841404804063953114%22">Even The Rich</a> (especially #FreeBritney) (Wondery)
I had a lot of sympathy for Britney after listening to this. I was never a fan, but sometimes I listen to random new stuff out of pure curiosity and learn some thangs.</li>
<li><a href="%22https://open.spotify.com/show/7gozmLqbcbr6PScMjc0Zl4?si=2FhslmelRyO1DHSxIxgZKw%22">Reply All</a> (Spotify)
Genius, I love this podcast so much. I just wish it came out every week. I realize greatness takes time. But still.</li>
<li><a href="%22https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p089sfrz%22">Grounded with Louis Theroux</a> (BBC Sounds)
Louis Theroux is that guy you wish you were friends with who makes any guest feel welcome and interesting. A random selection of guests from George O&rsquo;Dowd to UK reality TV stars I have never heard of keeps it fresh for me. Also, my son was impressed I knew who KSI was after he was featured on season 1 of the show.</li>
